## 🧮 Calculation Logic & Physics Engine

The core of Trip Master is its ability to estimate energy usage without a direct OBDII connection. It uses the following logic to derive consumption:

### 1. Distance & Slope
The system calculates the distance between two GPS coordinates using the **Haversine formula** to determine the shortest distance over the earth's surface. 
Distance is validated against a 5-meter movement threshold to filter out GPS "jitter" during stops.

### 2. The Energy Formula
For every recorded step, the energy consumption ($Wh$) is calculated using a simplified physics model:

$$E_{step} = \frac{(R_{base} \cdot d_{Km}) + E_{pot}}{Efficiency_{temp}}$$

**Where:**
* **Base Resistance ($R_{base}$)**: A derived constant accounting for rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag, adjusted by user-inputted headwind and vehicle weight. The formula used is roughly `(120 + (wind * 0.8) + (weight * 0.012))`.
* **Potential Energy ($E_{pot}$)**: Calculated as $\frac{m \cdot g \cdot \Delta h}{3600}$ to convert Joules to Watt-hours, where $m$ is weight and $\Delta h$ is the change in altitude.
* **Regenerative Braking**: If $E_{step}$ is negative (downhill), the system applies a **70% recuperation efficiency** factor to the potential energy gained, adding it to the "Brake Regen" total.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Assumptions

To maintain a lightweight, client-side architecture, the following assumptions are made:

* 🏎️ **Aerodynamic Drag**: The model uses a simplified linear scaling for wind resistance rather than a full quadratic drag equation.
* 🌡️ **Constant Efficiency**: The "Temp Efficiency" selection applies a global multiplier to simulate battery internal resistance.
* 🛰️ **GPS Altitude**: Accuracy is dependent on the device's GPS altimeter, which can be less precise than barometric sensors.
* 🔌 **Regen Fixed Rate**: Regenerative braking is capped at a 70% return rate and assumes the battery is not at 100% SoC.
